Release 1.6.5 of [R.NET on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/R.NET.Community) is available. 

Two intertwined reasons for this release:

* I managed to reproduce one of the issues that seems to arise on Windows machines where one installs side by side several versions of R. It seems that this changes the content of the keys in the Windows registry. 
* [A new R.NET documentation page hosted on GitHub pages](http://jmp75.github.io/rdotnet/). I was documenting pages relating to diagnosing the discovery of R paths to binaries and R_HOME on Windows.

Two benefits to this release:

* "Automagic" discovery of R paths on Windows should be more resilient
* There are additional diagnosis tools for when you need to report these types of issues; see [the ReportInfo project on R.NET onboarding](https://github.com/jmp75/rdotnet-onboarding/tree/master/ReportInfo) as an example.
